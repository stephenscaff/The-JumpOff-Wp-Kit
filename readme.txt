# The Jumpoff Wp Kit
A Wordpress / Codekit project starter and front-end framework


## What's That Now?
Oh, just a little Wordpress starter theme for CodeKit, including my own front-end framework. It contains all them common ui elements, a proportional grid & typographic system, some js stuff I use a good bit, SCSS configs and mixins (with Bourbon), and so on. On the Wp side, it holds a bunch of stuff I commonly rely on, in a structure I've found works well.


## You Gonna Document It Proper Like?
Maybe one of these days. This is more for me. And, it' undoubtably all kinds of sloppy right now - many todo cleanups afoot.
